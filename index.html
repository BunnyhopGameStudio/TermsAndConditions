    <h1>Terms of Conditions</h1>
    <h2>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p>Last Updated: June 2024</p>

    <p>These are the terms and conditions (the ‘T&Cs’) Bunnyhop Games (‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ use to govern our game which you have installed and includes the link you used to reach this page (the “Game”). We've tried to keep them as short as possible, to help you understand how you can use the Game.</p>

    <h2>1. Age Restriction</h2>
    <p>**You must be at least 13 years old in order to use the Games.** In addition, if you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian's consent to your use of the Games and your parent or legal guardian must agree to these Terms & Conditions.</p>

    <h2>2. Access and Use</h2>
    <p>You may access and use the Games without creating an account. However, certain features or functionalities within the Games may be limited.</p>

    <h2>3. Content and Ownership</h2>
    <p>The Games and all content therein, including but not limited to the software, graphics, sounds, and trademarks, are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You agree not to modify, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works of any content from the Games without our express written permission.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Games may integrate with third-party services. Your use of such services is subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE GAMES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE GAMES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE GAMES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE GAMES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

    <h2>7. Store Terms</h2>

    <p>The ways in which you can use the Game may be controlled by the relevant Store's terms and conditions and policies as made available to you by the Store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store). To the extent that there is a conflict between the terms of these T&Cs and the relevant Store's terms from which you purchased (where applicable) or installed the Game, the Store's terms shall prevail to the extent of the conflict.</p>

    <p>The Game may provide for certain additional content and features available through in-app purchase(s) (“Virtual Items”). The terms of this EULA and specifically this clause 7 shall govern all such Virtual Items.</p>

    <p>This clause applies insofar as the Game permits you to earn, obtain or use Virtual Items. You may use Virtual Items in connection with permitted use of the Game and, where applicable, in any third party applications in which such Virtual Items may also be used. You do not own the Virtual Items. You only have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use them, for their permitted uses, as may be amended and notified to you from time to time, in connection with the Game and subject to your compliance with the terms of this EULA. Where you purchase Virtual Items from us, the purchase will be subject to our then applicable terms of sale, including any additional fees that are applicable for Virtual Items that can be used in third party applications. These will be made available to you at the time of each purchase.</p>

    <p>If the Game offers a subscription-based premium feature package, it enables users to use the app without advertisements and with extra features. It will include an auto-renewable subscription, with a weekly subscription period. In this case, payment will be charged to your Store account upon confirmation of the subscription and the subscription period will be weekly. In this case subscription will be renewed unless turned off 24 hours before the end of the period, and the account will be automatically charged for renewal as well. If you subscribe, your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings in the Store. If a free trial period is offered and if you purchase a subscription, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited.</p>
